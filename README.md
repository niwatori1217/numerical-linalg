# Numerical Linear Algebra

This repository stores all my codes for the Numerical Linear Algebra course, and it basically consists of the following seven chapters:

- Chapter 1: Direct methods for linear systems
- Chapter 2: Error analysis for linear systems

All codes are implemented in Matlab. Numerical reports are also attached to illustrate the problem background and the algorithm principles.
