# Numerical Linear Algebra

This repository stores all my codes for the Numerical Linear Algebra course, and it basically consists of the following seven chapters:

- Chapter 1: Direct methods for linear systems
- Chapter 2: Error analysis for linear systems
- Chapter 3: Least squares problem
- Chapter 4: Classical iterations for linear systems
- (Chapter 5: Conjugate gradient method)
- Chapter 6: Unsymmetric eigenvalue problems
- (Chapter 7: Symmetric eigenvalue problems)

All codes are implemented in Matlab. Numerical reports are also attached to illustrate the problem background and the algorithm principles. Course project is to solve the two-dimensional Poisson equation with multigrid preconditioned conjugate gradient method, which is a fairly comprehensive piece of work.
